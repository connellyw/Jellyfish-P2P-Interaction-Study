For my project, I am taking a look at jellyfish’s regenerative capabilities.  I think that it is possible to learn something from the jellyfish’s cells.  It might even be possible to create gene therapy through studying jellyfish.  This unique property of advanced cell regeneration allows them to survive potentially life-threatening injuries and diseases.  Some jellyfish are known to even be able to regenerate eyes and nerves. (science direct)  Jellyfish have a supernature’s ability to regenerate body parts.  According to a study, certain cells can even regenerate multiple different organs through different stimuli. (NCBI)  Not only organs but muscle tissue and the body of the jellyfish.  Other stimuli cause jellyfish cell’s regeneration to be blocked. (elife sciences)  This means that there is a way to control the processes of the cells.  Possibly allowing for some application to aid humans.  Gaining a better understanding of these processes could lead to major medical breakthroughs.  It could lead to one day people being able to regrow missing limbs.  Maybe even find the cure to blindness and deafness.  To be able to research this, I will have to find the genes that are responsible for cellular regeneration.  I would like to be able to identify these traits in other jellyfish if possible.  To do this I could just use a program like BLAST to compare the jellyfish DNA sequences.  Then I want to take a look at the protein to protein interactions between the jellyfish proteins with other diseases and organisms.  I will do this using the tool Struck2Net to find homolog matches.  Struck2Net is an online web tool that compares two protein complexes to the protein database to find the best match.  I think that it is important to know the different interactions proteins can have with one another.  It could lead to a very important scientific discovery.
