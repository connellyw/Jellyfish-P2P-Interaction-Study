Before I continued with my project, I first had to do some additional background research first.  For the jellyfish I am using in my study, I had to do research on which ones I would be focusing on.  I decided that I would be focusing on the findings of the one study.  The one research article that I found for my proposal contained a link to Genbank for the gene they found responsible for regeneration in the cells.  A couple of different genes were identified in the study so I will be testing them individually.  After researching for a bioinformatics tool that would help me identify possible protein-protein interactions with the genes I decide to use the program HOMCOS.  HOMCOS is a program that helps with the searching and modeling of proteins.   This is what I am using in my project to help find what other proteins it could interact with.  Creating the model of the proteins is very important because it helps gives a visual representation of what is happening.  The program also shows the contact points between the two protein sequences which are very useful in looking at proteins with significant homology.   Amino acid contact molecules are also displayed showing where and how it exactly would bind.  This program I found extremely useful in my research that I have done so far.  Then, to find if these proteins would actually interact with each other I used a different tool.  I used PSOPIA which is the prediction server of protein to protein interactions.  This tool looks for similarities and differences in protein sequences.  It looks for the statistical propensities of domain pairs in the two protein sequences.  It works by entering in my base protein with one of the protein sequences that I collected from my tests using HOMCOS.  It then outputs scores of three different factors that go into the prediction of interaction.  The first one is the sequence similarities.  The second is the statistical propensities of domain-domain interactions.  The final one is the sum of edge weights between homologous protiens.  They get all added together at the end to determine the prediction of interaction.  Using this, I can start to get a better understanding of if there is actually a chance of these proteins interacting with each other.  I have started this process of research with one gene so far.  I have discovered that there are some interactions with other proteins that I will have to investigate further. I will have to see what the interaction is predicted to be.  By the end of the project, I would like to have a few genes that I will have tested.  This should give me more information on how these proteins can bind with each other.  I would also like to look into using STRING in my research down the road.  This tool I think could end up aiding me a lot for this research project.  It looks like it will be able to show me functional partners that could suggest what would happen when those two proteins interacted with each other.
